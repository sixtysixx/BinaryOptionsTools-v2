# Changelog

All notable changes to BinaryOptionsTools v2 will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
## [0.2.15]

### Added

- **Node.js Bindings**: Added `crates/bindings_napi`, an N-API (napi-rs) native addon exposing the PocketOption client, the raw WebSocket helpers, the message validators and the logging setup to JavaScript and TypeScript. The JavaScript examples and documentation previously referenced a `binary-options-tools.node` addon that did not exist anywhere in the repository, so none of them could run.
- Added the `nodejs/` package (`index.js`, `index.d.ts`, `scripts/build.js`, smoke tests) which loads the addon, adds `Symbol.asyncIterator` support to the subscription and raw streams, and exposes `snake_case` aliases next to the idiomatic `camelCase` method names.
- **SSID Fetchers**: Rewrote both CloseOption and PocketOption SSID extractor userscripts to use Violentmonkey/Tampermonkey menu commands only (no floating buttons, no `alert()`/`confirm()` dialogs). Added `GM_notification` support for success/error feedback.
- **CI/CD Cleanup**: Removed `docs-site` (Docusaurus documentation site) entirely from the repository. Deleted `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, removed `docs` job from CI, removed `docs` stage from `.gitlab-ci.yml`, and cleaned up `.dockerignore`.

### Changed

- Rewrote every script in `examples/javascript/` against the real API: they now take the session id from `process.argv[2]` or `POCKET_OPTION_SSID`, use the documented argument order (`buy(asset, amount, seconds)`), and shut the client down when finished.
- Updated the JavaScript sections of the documentation (`docs/examples/javascript`, `docs/api/reference.md`, `docs/architecture/structure.md`) to match the implemented API. The previous snippets referenced an `binaryoptionstoolsv2` npm package and methods such as `getClosedDeals()` that do not exist.

## [0.2.14] - 2026-08-28
### Added
- **CloseOption Support**: Added new `closeoption` module for the CloseOption binary options platform, supporting Socket.IO EIO=3 protocol on `wss://www.closeoption.com:8443`.
- Added `CloseOptionAsync` and `CloseOption` Python clients mirroring the PocketOption API.
- Added PyO3 bindings for CloseOption with full async method support.
- **Historical Tick Data**: Added `get_ticks(asset, lookback_seconds)` method to `PocketOptionAsync`, `PocketOption` (sync), and `RawPocketOption` clients for fetching raw tick history via `loadHistoryPeriod` WebSocket message with pagination.
- Added `get_ticks.py` examples for both async and sync Python APIs.

### Fixed

- **Critical: Request/Response Routing**: Fixed `send_and_wait` to properly route responses via `HashMap<u64, oneshot::Sender>` registry instead of creating orphaned channels that always timeout.
- **Implemented missing methods**: Added `payout`, `history`, `opened_deals`, `closed_deals`, `get_candles_live`, `raw_handler`, `subscribe_symbol`, `subscribe_raw`, and `reconnect` to the Rust `CloseOption` client.
- **Fixed duplicate code**: Extracted `duration_to_time_intervals()` helper to eliminate duplicated duration-mapping logic in `buy` and `sell` methods.
- **Implemented check_win**: Changed from stub returning error to functional implementation using asset lookup.
- **Removed unused code**: Eliminated dead `engine_io_type` variable and unused `state` field from `KeepAliveModule`.

### Changed

- Updated all internal crates to version `0.2.14`.

## [0.2.13] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Live Candle Streaming**: Added `get_candles_live` method to both `PocketOptionAsync` (async) and `PocketOption` (sync) clients, which implements gap-free real-time candle building and backfilling.
- Added a 15-second per-test-function global timeout to the pytest suite to prevent hangs.

### Changed

- Deprecated duplicate candle functions `candles()` and `get_candles()` in favor of `get_candles_live()`.
- Redirected the deprecated methods to run `get_candles_live()` internally (returning the first yielded closed candle list) to maintain backward compatibility.

### Fixed

- **Robust Connection Handoff**: Wrapped historical candle fetching API calls within `get_candles_live()` with short timeouts and try-except fallbacks, preventing connection initialization hangs when compile-candles or tick history endpoints are slow or rate-limited.
- Removed anti-pattern `hasattr(client, "send_raw")` in unit tests, replacing it with direct calls to `await client.send_raw(...)`.
- Updated all internal crates and dependencies to version `0.2.13`.

## [0.2.12] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **UTC Candle Compilation**: Refactored candle compilation to fetch raw 1-second ticks and manually build candles based on UTC time boundaries (`timestamp / period * period`), avoiding server-side candle time-alignment mismatches, overlaps, and gaps.
- Added `getBalance` to initial connection messages to ensure balance is fetched immediately upon reconnecting.
- Added warnings and logging to previously swallowed async channel errors.
- Exposed more functions in the python documentation wrapper.

### Changed

- Replaced the Notify-based wait primitives in `Signals` with stateful `tokio::sync::watch` to prevent TOCTOU race conditions.
- Derived `Debug` for `Action` in `crates/bindings_pyo3/src/framework.rs` to fix test compilation.
- Updated all internal crates and dependencies to version `0.2.12`.

### Fixed

- Fixed subscription restoration to fire on both `on_connect` and `on_reconnect` paths so subscriptions are not lost on explicit disconnects.
- Fixed memory leaks: Added pruning/eviction to `latest_ticks` in `GetCandlesApiModule` and cleared pending state (`pending_market_orders`, `recent_trades`, `pending_deals`) on reconnection.
- Fixed panics: Replaced `.expect()` calls with poison recovery (`.unwrap_or_else(|e| e.into_inner())`) in `state.rs` and `raw.rs`, and returned `Result` from `RuleBuilder::regex()` instead of panicking on invalid regexes.
- Fixed module lifecycle hang: Implemented proper waiter notification on module `Drop` for `PendingTrades`, `Raw`, and `HistoricalData` modules.
- Fixed command queue mismatches in `pending_trades.rs` by separating queues per command type.

## [0.2.10] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Rule macro system with DSL support for ergonomic rule definitions (`#[rule({ starts_with("42") & !contains("error") })]`)
- Per-language documentation macro for BinaryOptionsToolsUni crate
- Demo test example for verifying library functionality (connection, subscriptions, candle fetching)
- Trade state regression test
- Documentation JSON files for API modules (error, pocket_option, raw_handler, stream, types, validator)
- Max subscriptions configuration in State builder (default: 4)
- Memory pruning for closed deals (limit to 1000) to prevent memory growth

### Changed

- **Major core crate refactoring**: Removed `core-pre` crate and consolidated into `core` crate
- Improved SSID parsing with double-encoding detection and regex recovery for malformed JSON
- Enhanced deals module with better Socket.IO frame handling and message pattern matching
- Refactored historical data module for improved reliability
- Updated README with new Python bot framework examples and corrected version support
- Updated Python version support (dropped 3.8, 3.13, 3.14, 3.15)
- Dependency updates across multiple directories

### Fixed

- Fixed check win functionality
- Fixed documentation errors in Rust source
- Fixed source distribution (sdist) build

## [0.2.9] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- N/a

### Changed

- Updated python support
- Improved SSID parsing to prevent double encoded JSON msgs
- Minor docs updates

### Fixed

- Fixed auth failure with valid SSID: `Ssid::Display` now returns the raw auth message (`42["auth",{...}]`) instead of a human-readable label, so the correct credential string is sent to the server during WebSocket handshake.
- Balance returning -1 (possibly)
- Unsafe unwraps

## [0.2.8] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- Pre-registration API on `ResponseRouter` to eliminate race conditions in command responses
- SSID Fetcher UserScript for easier SSID extraction from browser
- Framework improvements: `on_balance_update` now works correctly
- Support for storing indicators in the Python framework
- PyStrategy integration improvements

### Changed (Breaking Logic)

- **Virtual Market Profit Semantics**: `Deal.profit` now stores **net gain/loss** (e.g., -stake on loss, 0 on draw, stake payout % on win) instead of total payout.
- **WebSocket Event System**: Unified on `EventHandler` trait and tuple/unit variants for `WebSocketEvent`. Custom handlers must update their signatures and can now provide an optional `name()`.
- **Enhanced Client Architecture**: Updated `EnhancedWebSocketInner` to require and store `credentials`, `handler`, and `connector`.
- **Context Manager Lifecycle**: Exiting the `PocketOption` context manager now explicitly closes the internal event loop, preventing resource leaks but also preventing instance reuse.

### Changed

- Updated `BinaryOptionsToolsV2.pyi` to match the actual Rust return types (JSON strings/Lists instead of Dicts).
- Updated documentation and README
- Code quality improvements and clippy fixes
- CI workflow updated for stable PyO3
- Thread-safe `buy()` calls in synchronous client via `threading.RLock()`
- Removed unused `resend_connection_messages` method

### Fixed

- Event loop leak in Python synchronous client by fixing `__exit__` and `close()` logic.
- Boxing issues in `BinaryOptionsToolsError::WebsocketConnectionError` variant.
- API mismatches in `client2.rs` preventing successful compilation.
- Fixed `on_balance_update` event handling.
- Fixed concurrent test failures.
- Fixed failing pytest tests.
- Fixed pending trades test.
- Fixed PyO3 compatibility issues with `chrono::Duration`.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- Robust SSID parsing supporting complex PHP serialized session objects and sanitized Socket.IO frames
- Automated asset and payout gathering (`AssetsModule`) upon connection
- New `wait_for_assets` method to ensure library readiness before operations
- Refactored GitHub Issue and Pull Request templates

- Real event handler removal by name in `WebSocketClient2`
- Preserve original event variants when broadcasting events in `WebSocketClient2`

### Changed (Breaking Logic)

- **Virtual Market Profit Semantics**: `Deal.profit` now stores **net gain/loss** (e.g., -stake on loss, 0 on draw, stake payout % on win) instead of total payout.
- **WebSocket Event System**: Unified on `EventHandler` trait and tuple/unit variants for `WebSocketEvent`. Custom handlers must update their signatures and can now provide an optional `name()`.
- **Enhanced Client Architecture**: Updated `EnhancedWebSocketInner` to require and store `credentials`, `handler`, and `connector`.
- **Context Manager Lifecycle**: Exiting the `PocketOption` context manager now explicitly closes the internal event loop, preventing resource leaks but also preventing instance reuse.

### Changed

- Increased historical data and pending order timeouts to 30s for enhanced reliability during network congestion
- Improved WebSocket routing rules (`TwoStepRule`, `MultiPatternRule`) to be resilient against interleaved messages
- Updated documentation deployment workflow to include `mkdocstrings` dependencies (gh pages)
- Reorganized internal project scripts
- Updated `BinaryOptionsToolsV2.pyi` to match the actual Rust return types (JSON strings/Lists instead of Dicts).
- Improved message sending priority by using biased polling in `EnhancedWebSocketClient`.
- Enhanced event dispatching with concurrency limiting (semaphore) in `WebSocketClient2`.

### Fixed

- GitHub Pages 404 error by normalizing documentation filenames to lowercase (`index.md`).

- Event loop leak in Python synchronous client by fixing `__exit__` and `close()` logic.
- Boxing issues in `BinaryOptionsToolsError::WebsocketConnectionError` variant.
- API mismatches in `client2.rs` preventing successful compilation.
